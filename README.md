# This repository and the search engine developed is an outcome of the project Quality Assurance of Machine Learning Applications (Q-AMeLiA).
The goal of the project is to support Small and medium-sized enterprises (SME's) in the process of the special machine learning software development life cycle (ML-SDLC) and to develop quality indicators that are important in this process. 
In total five SME's namely competition it-management GmbH, Inferics GmbH, C.R.S. iiMotion GmbH, tepcon GmbH, and schrempp edv GmbH collaborate with three universities namely Hochschule Furtwangen, Hochschule Karlsruhe, and Hochschule Offenburg attempt to develop suitable tools to evaluate the data quality in terms of representative coverage of the feature space as well as to evaluate the quality of the learned AI model achieved in the learning process. 
This safeguards the product risk of the manufacturer of AI-based products and assures the customer of a quantified performance of the products concerning the decision-making of the AI. 
More about the project can be found on the project website (https://q-amelia.in.hs-furtwangen.de/).

# Find My CNN: Search Engine for ML models
One of the major difficulties often faced by ML practitioners is not knowing what different deep learning models exist for a particular use case. 
There is not a single model database across various domains which exist and could provide a starting point to SME's when applying ML for the first time.
